# Browser Autofill Phishing 🐟

This is a simple demonstration (in the Google Chrome) of form fields hidden from the user, but will be
filled anyways when using the browser form autofill feature, which poses a
security risk for users, unaware of giving their information to the website.

It works differently in some other browsers. For example:

* In Safari, it will tell you all the data it is filling into the form, even if it isn't visible to you.

* In Firefox, you have to right click an input field and then select an identity to use. So in Firefox user autofills each field.
